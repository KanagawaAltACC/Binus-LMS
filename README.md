## Binus LMS Unofficial Client
### Unofficial Desktop Client of Binus LMS, Built in Electron


How to install?

- Go to Release page and get your LMS Unofficial Client
- for ubuntu / Debian:
   ```sudo apt install binus-lms-client_1.0.0_amd64.deb```
- for Arch Linux:
  ```sudo pacman -U binus-lms-client-1.0.0.pacman```
- AppImage:
  ```Execute as program, then double click```
- Windows:
  ```Download Run the .exe (There's "Setup" if you want to install & Portable app (No Setup))```
- MacOS: 
  ```Just launch the .dmg``` <br />

Note: 
- Since I don't have Macbook or Apple device... Consider MacOS Build is untested
- Also, I don't have Apple Developer Account, so it gives you warning when run it (Ignore it, it's because the .dmg is unsinged. Even I use GitHub action to build it) 
- Same with the Windows setup version, since I don't have the funds to sign the app. I only rely on the built in signtool, so it will show a warning
