## Binus LMS Unofficial Client
### Unofficial Desktop Client of Binus LMS, Built in Electron

How to Install?
- Go to Release page and get your LMS Unofficial Client
- for ubuntu / Debian:
   ```sudo apt install binus-lms-client_1.0.0_amd64.deb```
- AppImage:
  ```Execute as program, then double click```
- Windows:
  ```Download Run the .exe (There's "Setup" if you want to install & Portable app (No Setup))```
- MacOS: 
  ```Just launch the .dmg``` <br />

Note: 
- Since I don't have Macbook or Apple device... Consider MacOS Build is untested
- Also, I don't have Apple Developer Account, so it gives you warning when run it (Ignore it, it's because the .dmg is unsinged. Even I use GitHub action to build it) 

## Windows SmartScreen Warning

When downloading and running the app, you may see a "Windows protected your PC" warning. This is normal for unsigned applications.

### How to install safely:

1. Click "More info" in the SmartScreen dialog
2. Click "Run anyway"
3. This is safe because:
   - ✅ Source code is publicly available
   - ✅ Built with GitHub Actions (transparent build process)
   - ✅ No malicious code (you can verify yourself)

### Why this happens:
- Code signing certificates cost $100-400/year
- As an open-source developer, I can't afford this
